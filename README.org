* Overview

  =Sevil= is my evil Emacs config - a light weight Emacs with modern editor
  features (e.g. vim's keybinding).

** Structure

   Group by folders and files:

   + =core=: core utility essential to editor
     + =boot=: Emacs internal setting
     + =const=: constants and helper functions
     + =dev=: development relating tools
     + =edit=: editing config like jumping and checking
     + =esehll/shell=: shell settings
     + =evil=: keybinding
     + =highlight=: highlight content such as paren and lines
     + =ivy=: configuration of fuzzy matching framework Ivy
     + =lsp=: language server and auto-complete settings
     + =note=: noting by org mode or markdown
     + =ui=: the UI of Emacs like themes
     + =util=: misc tools
     + =window=: windows managements by winner
     + =persp/treemacs=: separated settings for two packages
   + =lang=: programming language settings
     + ...

   Some notable plugins:

   + /straight/: a package manager which downloads from git directly; compare to
     /package.el/, I don't want to spend time on push plugins to Melpa
   + /use-package/: a macro allows us to write config elegantly
   + /lsp-mode/: LSP client for Emacs; save your life from different language configurations
   + /ivy/: a lightweight fuzzy matching
   + /evil/: use Vim keybindings in Emacs (for detailed key bindings, please
     visit =core/init-evil.el=)
   + ...
